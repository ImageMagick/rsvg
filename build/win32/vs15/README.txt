Note that all this is rather experimental.

Please do not compile librsvg in a path with spaces to avoid potential
problems during the build and/or during the usage of the librsvg
library.

Please refer to the following GNOME Live! page for more detailed
instructions on building librsvg and its dependencies with Visual C++:

https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/Win32/MSVCCompilationOfGTKStack

This VS15 solution and the projects it includes are intented to be used
in a librsvg source tree unpacked from a tarball. In a git checkout you
first need to use some Unix-like environment or manual work to expand
files as needed, for instance the .vcprojin files here into .vcproj
files.

It is recommended that GLib, libxml2, libcroco, Cairo, Pango is compiled
with VS15 to compile librsvg.

External dependencies are at least Cairo, GLib, libxml2, libcroco, GDK-Pixbuf
Please see the build\win32\vs15\README.txt file in glib for details where to
unpack them.

It is recommended that one builds the dependencies with VS15 as far as
possible, especially those from and using the GTK+ stack (i.e. GDK-Pixbuf,
Pango, GLib and Cairo), so that crashes caused by mixing calls to different
CRTs can be kept at a minimum.

libxml2 and Cairo do contain support for compiling under VS15
using VS project files and/or makefiles at this time of writing.
For GDK-Pixbuf, Pango, libcroco and GLib, VS15 project files are
available under $(srcroot)\build\vs15.

Set up the source tree as follows under some arbitrary top folder
<root>:

<root>\<this-librsvg-source-tree>
<root>\vs15\<PlatformName>

Note: put the resulting Cairo and libxml2 files as follows:
 .dll files: <root>\vs15\<PlatformName>\bin
 .lib files: <root>\vs15\<PlatformName>\lib
 .h files: <root>\vs15\<PlatformName>\include

The recommended build order for these dependencies:
-libxml2
-(optional for GLib) PCRE (version 8.12 or later, use of CMake to
  build PCRE is recommended-see build\win32\vs15\README.txt of GLib)
-GLib (put the sources in <root>\<GLib-Source-Tree>, and build it from
       there with VS15)
-libcroco
-Cairo
-Pango
-Gdk-Pixbuf
-ATK and GTK (Version 3.10+, if building the GTK+ viewer program)

*this* file you are now reading is thus located at
<root>\<this-librsvg-source-tree>\build\win32\vs15\README.txt.

<PlatformName> is either Win32 or x64, as in VS15 project files.

The "install" project will copy build results and headers into their
appropriate location under <root>\vs15\<PlatformName>. For instance,
built DLLs go into <root>\vs15\<PlatformName>\bin, built LIBs into
<root>\vs15\<PlatformName>\lib and headers into
<root>\vs15\<PlatformName>\include\librsvg-2.0. This is then from where
project files higher in the stack are supposed to look for them, not
from a specific librsvg source tree like this one. It is important to
keep separate the concept of a "source tree", where also non-public
headers are present, and an "install tree" where only public headers
are present.
